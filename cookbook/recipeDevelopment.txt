Breakfast Tart with Pommes Anna Potato Crust, Caramelized Onions & Gruyère
Pommes Anna Potato Crust

Ingredients

1¼ lbs (570 g) Yukon Gold potatoes
3 tbsp (45 g) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing
1–2 tsp olive oil, for brushing exposed edges if desired
1 tsp kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Equipment

9-inch tart pan (preferably with removable bottom) or pie pan
Mandoline slicer or sharp knife
Parchment paper (optional)
Sheet tray (to support pan and catch drips)

Instructions

Preheat and Prepare Pan
Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C).
Grease the tart pan generously with melted butter, including up the sides.
Optional: line the bottom with a round of parchment for easier release.
Slice the Potatoes
Peel and slice potatoes into 1.5–2 mm (~1/16-inch) rounds using a mandoline or very sharp knife.
Do not rinse after slicing — the surface starch helps the slices adhere and hold shape.
Season and Coat
In a large bowl, gently toss the slices with melted butter, salt, and a few grinds of pepper, ensuring each slice is evenly coated.

Assemble the Crust

Starting from the center, arrange potato slices in overlapping concentric circles to cover the base.
Continue layering the slices, extending slightly up the sides to form a shallow crust.
Press gently to compress and adhere the layers.
Brush the upper edges of the crust with olive oil if desired for extra browning.
Parbake the Crust
Place the tart pan on a sheet tray and bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the bottom starts to turn golden and edges are lightly crisped.
If edges brown too fast, cover them loosely with foil.
Cool Before Filling
Remove from oven and let cool for 15–20 minutes, uncovered to allow the starches to set before adding the custard filling.
Caramelized Onions (for Tart)

Yield: ~¾ cup finished

Ingredients

1 lb (450 g) yellow onions (about 2 large), thinly sliced
1 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp kosher salt
Optional: splash of water, stock, or white wine for deglazing
Instructions

Prep the onions

Peel and halve the onions lengthwise (pole to pole), then slice thinly (about ⅛ inch) following the grain. This helps them hold texture while softening beautifully.
Start the caramelization
Heat butter and olive oil in a wide, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat.
Add sliced onions and salt. Stir to coat.
Add 2–3 sprigs of fresh thyme to the pan with the onions. Keep them whole and nestle them under the onions occasionally as they cook to gently infuse the mixture without scorching. Discard the stems once the onions are fully caramelized.
Cook the onions over medium heat until they soften and begin to turn golden, about 10–15 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium-low.
Continue cooking slowly for 40–60 minutes, stirring more frequently as they begin to darken, and constantly toward the end to prevent burning.
If the onions brown too quickly at any point, reduce the heat. If fond (the browned bits on the bottom) begins to build up excessively, deglaze the pan with a tablespoon or two of water or white wine and stir it in. Think of lowering the heat as a “slow brake” and deglazing as a “fast brake” to control temperature and prevent burning during the caramelization process. Finish and cool
When onions are deep golden brown and jammy, remove from heat.
Cool completely before adding to the tart.
Make-Ahead Instructions

Store cooled caramelized onions in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Bring to room temperature or gently reheat before using in the tart to avoid chilling the custard mixture.
Custard & Assembly

Ingredients

4 large eggs
¾ cup (180 ml) heavy cream
1 tsp Dijon mustard
½ tsp kosher salt
⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper
Pinch of ground nutmeg
1 cup (85 g) grated Gruyère, divided
Caramelized onions (from previous step)
Prebaked Pommes Anna potato crust (cooled)

Instructions

In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, Dijon, salt, pepper, and nutmeg until fully combined.
Stir in ⅔ of the grated Gruyère (about ⅔ cup).
Spread the caramelized onions evenly over the bottom of the cooled potato crust.
Pour the custard mixture over the onions.
Sprinkle the remaining Gruyère evenly over the top.
Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 30–35 minutes, until the center is just set and the top is golden.
Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
Crème Fraîche & Chive Topping (optional)

Ingredients

½ cup crème fraîche or sour cream
1 tbsp fresh chives, finely chopped
1 tsp lemon zest
Pinch of kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Instructions

In a small bowl, stir together crème fraîche, chives, lemon zest, salt, and pepper until smooth and evenly combined.
Chill until ready to serve. Serve a small spoonful alongside each slice of tart.
