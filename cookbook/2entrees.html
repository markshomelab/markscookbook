   Crisp salmon fillets glazed with teriyaki sauce.
  </p>
<h3>
   Ingredients
  </h3>
<ul>
<li>
    1 lb (450 g) skin-on Atlantic salmon fillet (or two 7 oz / 200 g fillets)
   </li>
<li>
    Kosher salt, to taste
   </li>
<li>
    High-smoke-point oil (e.g., avocado oil), for cooking

<li>Teriyaki Marinade and Glaze (<a href="5sauces.html#5.14-teriyaki-marinade-and-glaze">see recipe</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>
   Instructions
  </h3>
<ol>
<li>
    Slice salmon into fillets and pat dry. Season lightly with salt.
   </li>
<li>
    Heat oil in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Sear salmon skin-side down for 3–4 minutes, or until the color has changed about 60% up the side of the fillet.
   </li>
<li>
    Flip, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook 1 minute more until internal temp is 125–130°F (50–55°C).

<li>
    Ensure the pan is hot for a crispy skin.

   Description
  </h3>
<p>
   A rich, restaurant-quality dish featuring tender chicken cutlets in a glossy Marsala wine and mushroom sauce. This version layers flavor through pancetta (or bacon), dried and fresh mushrooms, and a gelatin-enriched reduction for body. A standout meal for special occasions or Sunday dinners.
  </p>
<h3>
   Ingredients
  </h3>
<ul>
<li>
    4 (8 oz / 225 g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts (**2 lbs / 900 g total**)
   </li>
<li>
    Kosher salt
   </li>
<li>
    About 1 cup (120 g) all-purpose flour, for dredging (gluten-free blend works well)
   </li>
<li>
    Olive oil, for pan-frying
   </li>
<li>
    650 g (2¾ cups) Dry Marsala wine, plus extra for deglazing
   </li>
<li>
    350 g (1½ cups) chicken stock, plus extra to loosen sauce
   </li>
<li>
    2 packets (14–15 g total) powdered gelatin
   </li>
<li>
    30 g (1 cup) dried mushrooms (shiitake or porcini)
   </li>
<li>
    1 lb (450 g) baby bella mushrooms, sliced
   </li>
<li>
    100 g (3.5 oz) pancetta or thick-cut bacon, diced
   </li>
<li>
    ½ large onion (100 g), finely diced
   </li>
<li>
    15 g (2–3 cloves) garlic, minced
   </li>
<li>
    15 g (1 tbsp) tomato paste
   </li>
<li>
    1 tsp (1 g) dried oregano
   </li>
<li>
    20 g (1½ tbsp) Worcestershire sauce
   </li>
<li>
    50 g (4 tbsp) cold unsalted butter
   </li>
<li>
    1 tbsp (5 g) chopped parsley, for garnish
   </li>
</ul>
<h3>
   Instructions
  </h3>
<ol>
<li>
    **Prep the Chicken:** Slice each chicken breast in half horizontally to make 8 thin cutlets. Pound to even thickness inside a freezer bag using a saucepan or meat mallet. Season generously with salt and let sit for 10–15 minutes to dry-brine while preparing the sauce base.
   </li>
<li>
    **Make the Reduction:** In a saucepan, combine Marsala wine, chicken stock, gelatin, and dried mushrooms. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until reduced by half. Strain through a fine mesh sieve, pressing on mushrooms to extract all liquid. Discard mushrooms.
   </li>
<li>
    **Dredge and Brown the Chicken:** Lightly dredge cutlets in flour, shaking off excess. Heat olive oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat and sear chicken in batches until golden brown—about 2–3 minutes per side. Transfer to a tray and keep warm.
   </li>
<li>
    **Sauté the Mushrooms:** In the same pan, add more olive oil if needed and sauté the fresh mushrooms with a pinch of salt until deeply browned and tender, about 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
   </li>
<li>
    **Cook the Pancetta:** Add pancetta or bacon to the pan and cook until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and add to the mushroom bowl. Drain off most of the fat, leaving about 1 tablespoon behind.
   </li>
<li>
    **Build the Sauce Base:** Sauté diced onion in reserved fat until soft and lightly golden, 1–2 minutes. Stir in garlic, tomato paste, and oregano; cook until fragrant and tomato paste darkens. Deglaze with a splash of Marsala wine and reduce briefly.
   </li>
<li>
    **Finish the Sauce:** Add Worcestershire sauce and the reserved Marsala-mushroom reduction. Bring to a simmer. Nestle chicken cutlets into the sauce and baste for 1 minute to glaze. Do not overcook. Transfer cutlets to a warm dish.
   </li>
<li>
    **Emulsify the Sauce:** Add the mushrooms and pancetta back to the pan. Loosen with a splash of stock if too thick. Off heat, swirl in cold butter until glossy. Fold in chopped parsley.
   </li>
<li>
    **Serve:** Spoon mushrooms and sauce over each cutlet. Serve immediately.
   </li>
</ol>
<h3>
   Notes
  </h3>
<ul>
<li>
    Dried mushrooms deepen the umami base—don’t skip them.
   </li>
<li>
    Gelatin adds body and cling without muting flavor like cornstarch.
   </li>
<li>
    Use sweet Marsala, not dry, for best flavor balance.
   </li>
<li>
    Excellent with mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or Parmesan polenta.

</h3>
<p>
  A deeply savory, browned ground beef filling for tacos, burritos, or tostadas. Tomato paste, garlic, and your homemade <a href="6seasonings.html#6.3-taco-seasoning">Taco Seasoning Mix</a> deliver bold, concentrated flavor. Ideal for gatherings with a toppings bar.
</p>
<h3>
  Ingredients
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 lb (450 g) ground beef</li>
  <li>½ medium onion (about 75 g), diced</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>2–3 tbsp (30–45 g) tomato paste</li>
  <li>2 tbsp <a href="6seasonings.html#6.3-taco-seasoning">Taco Seasoning Mix</a></li>
  <li>2–4 tbsp (30–60 ml) water, as needed</li>
  <li>Kosher salt, to taste (about 1 tsp per lb of beef)</li>
  <li>2 limes, cut into wedges</li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Instructions
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Add the ground beef to a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sprinkle with salt and break the meat up with a spoon or spatula.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in the diced onions. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, as the beef releases moisture and then begins to dry and brown.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lower the heat to medium. Once the onions are soft and the beef is deeply browned, stir in the tomato paste. Cook for 2 minutes to caramelize and develop sweetness.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more, stirring constantly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in the Taco Seasoning Mix. Once incorporated, add 2–4 tbsp of water to prevent the spices from burning. St untilir evenly mixed and the texture is cohesive but not wet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Taste and adjust seasoning: add salt as needed, a squeeze of lime for brightness, or a pinch of sugar to balance acidity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Serve hot on warm corn or <a href="7breads.html#7.1-flour-tortillas">flour tortillas</a>, on tostadas or taco salad, and with your favorite toppings. A squeeze of lime juice really makes it pop!
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>
  Notes
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    For American-style tacos: top with shredded Monterey Jack, lettuce, salsa, tomatoes, onions, and sour cream.
  </li>
  <li>
    For Mexican-style tacos: try shredded cabbage, diced white onion, salsa, cilantro, cotija cheese, crema, and lime juice.
  </li>
  <li>
    The recipe scales well for parties without adding much work and leftovers freeze well.

  2.11 Egg Roll in a Bowl
</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    Serves: 4  Prep Time: 10 minutes  Cook Time: 15 minutes  Total Time: 25 minutes
  </strong>
</p>
<h3>
  Description
</h3>
<p>
  A fast, skillet-cooked dish inspired by the flavors of a classic egg roll—minus the wrapper. Ground beef is browned for deep flavor, then combined with tender-crisp cabbage, savory aromatics, and a bold, umami-rich sauce. Ideal for low-carb meals or easy weeknight dinners.
</p>
<h3>
  Ingredients
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 lb (450 g) ground beef (80/20 chuck recommended)</li>
  <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 tbsp (12 g) fresh ginger, grated</li>
  <li>1 small jalapeño, minced (optional, seeded for less heat)</li>
  <li>16 oz (450 g) green cabbage, thinly shredded (¼-inch wide)</li>
  <li>¼ cup (25 g) scallions, sliced (reserve some for garnish)</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Sauce:</strong></li>
<ul>
  <li>2½ tbsp (37 ml) soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 tbsp (18 g) oyster sauce</li>
  <li>1 tbsp (18 g) hoisin sauce</li>
  <li>1–1½ tbsp (15–22 ml) sriracha</li>
  <li>1 tsp (5 ml) toasted sesame oil</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp rice vinegar or lime juice (to finish)</li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Instructions
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    In a small bowl, whisk together all sauce ingredients: soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, sriracha, sesame oil, and optional rice vinegar or lime juice. Set aside.
  </li>
  <li>
    Over medium-high heat in a large skillet, wok, or Dutch oven—whichever gives you enough space to brown the beef and cook down the cabbage without overcrowding—add the ground beef and break it into chunks. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and press it into the pan. Let it cook undisturbed for 2–3 minutes to develop browning, then stir and continue cooking until deeply browned and cooked through. Reserve about 2 tablespoons of fat and drain the rest, or blot it with a paper towel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Push the beef to the edges of the pan. In the center, sauté the garlic, ginger, and jalapeño in the rendered fat for 30–60 seconds until fragrant, then stir into the beef.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the shredded cabbage and toss to coat. Cook 3–5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is tender-crisp. Let it sit undisturbed briefly to encourage some browning.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pour in the prepared sauce and stir to coat evenly. Cook for 1–2 minutes more to allow the sauce to reduce and cling to the mixture.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in scallions. Taste and adjust seasoning—add lime juice or vinegar if desired for brightness.
  </li>
  <li>
    Serve hot, garnished with extra scallions. Pairs well with steamed rice or cauliflower rice.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>
  Notes
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
   Use pre-shredded coleslaw mix as a shortcut, but avoid mixes with carrots if aiming for keto.
  </li>
  <li>
   To make it sweeter, increase hoisin to 1½ tbsp.
  </li>
  <li>
  Feel free to swap in other proteins such as chicken, shrimp, or tofu—just keep in mind that they’ll require different cooking times and techniques than ground beef.

<h3>
  Description
</h3>
<p>
  A beloved Haitian dish of marinated pork shoulder simmered until tender, then broiled until caramelized and crispy. Bright with citrus, deeply seasoned with garlic and Scotch bonnet pepper, and traditionally served with rice and <a href="5sauces.html#5.13-pikliz-spicy-pickled-haitian-slaw">Pikliz</a>.
</p>
<h3>
  Ingredients
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 Scotch bonnet or habanero pepper, quartered and seeded (use gloves!)</li>
  <li>1 medium red onion, chopped</li>
  <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
  <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
  <li>1 small bunch parsley (about 1 cup chopped)</li>
  <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>2 tsp dried thyme</li>
  <li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>½ cup sour orange juice <em>(or ¼ cup lime juice + ¼ cup orange juice)</em></li>
  <li>2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
  <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>2 tbsp lime juice</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
  <li>2½ lbs (1.1 kg) pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
  <li>2–3 tbsp neutral oil (for broiling)</li>
  <li>Additional parsley and thyme leaves, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Instructions
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Wearing gloves, quarter the chile and remove seeds and membranes. Finely chop one quarter of the chile; leave the rest in large pieces.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, combine the chopped and whole chile with the onion, bell peppers, parsley, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir in the citrus juices, vinegar, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Add the pork and toss to coat thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove the pot from the fridge 1–3 hours before cooking. Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). Place the pot on the stove over high heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for 1½ to 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until pork is very tender and the liquid has mostly reduced.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to a rimmed baking sheet, discarding vegetable solids and any herb stems. Let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, strain the braising liquid into a clean saucepan and simmer over high heat until reduced by half, about 25–30 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preheat the broiler. Drizzle pork with 2 tablespoons oil and season lightly with salt. Broil for 5–10 minutes, tossing once or twice, until evenly browned but still juicy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drizzle with some of the reduced sauce and garnish with chopped parsley and fresh thyme leaves. Serve hot with rice and <a href="5sauces.html#5.13-pikliz-spicy-pickled-haitian-slaw">Pikliz</a>.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>
  Notes
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    For best flavor, marinate the pork overnight. Let it come closer to room temperature before cooking.
  </li>
  <li>
    If using a very spicy chile, you can omit the chopped portion and use only the large pieces to infuse heat more gently.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sour orange juice can be found in Latin and Caribbean markets. If unavailable, a blend of citrus juices works well.

  </p>
<h3>
   Ingredients
  </h3>
<ul>
<li>
    8–10 chicken thighs, legs, or wings (2½–3 lbs / 1.1–1.4 kg)
   </li>
<li>
    2 tbsp (12 g) five-spice powder
   </li>
<li>
    Juice of 2 limes
   </li>
<li>
    3 tbsp (45 ml) soy sauce
   </li>
<li>
    1 (2-inch) knob ginger, minced (1 tbsp / 10 g)
   </li>
<li>
    ½ cup (120 ml) neutral oil (canola or grapeseed)
   </li>
<li>
    2 tbsp (30 ml) sesame oil
   </li>
<li>
    ½ cup (120 ml) oyster sauce

<li>
    ¼ cup (15 g) chopped scallions, for garnish
   </li>
</ul>
<h3>
   Instructions
  </h3>
<ol>
<li>
    **Marinate**: Toss chicken with five-spice, lime juice, soy sauce, and ginger. Refrigerate for 1 hour to overnight.
   </li>
<li>
    **Fry**: Heat neutral and sesame oils in a skillet over medium-high. Fry chicken in batches, turning often, 15–20 minutes.
   </li>
<li>
    **Sauce**: Mix oyster sauce, Scotch bonnet sauce, lime juice, and black pepper. Adjust seasoning.
   </li>
<li>
    **Serve**: Garnish with scallions. Serve with rice and extra sauce on the side.
   </li>
</ol>
<h3>
   Notes
  </h3>
<ul>
<li>
    For best texture, cook dark meat chicken to an internal temperature of at least 175°F (79°C)—even up to 185°F (85°C)—for optimal tenderness. This ensures the connective tissue fully breaks down for tender, juicy meat.
   </li>
<li>
    Adjust Scotch bonnet sauce to control spiciness.

<li>
    4 strips bacon, sliced
   </li>
<li>
    2½ lbs (1.1 kg) beef chuck, cut into 2-inch pieces
   </li>
<li>
    Kosher salt, to taste

<li>
    4 cloves garlic, minced
   </li>
<li>
    ¼ cup (60 g) tomato paste
   </li>
<li>
    1 can (12–14 oz / 355–414 ml) Irish stout (e.g., Guinness)
   </li>
<li>
    4 sprigs fresh thyme
   </li>
<li>
    3 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces

<li>
    2½ cups (600 ml) chicken stock
   </li>
<li>
    1 tsp (5 g) sugar
   </li>
</ul>
<h3>
   Instructions
  </h3>
<ol>
<li>
    Cook bacon in a skillet until crisp. Transfer to a stew pot, reserving the fat.
   </li>
<li>
    Season beef with salt and pepper. Working in batches, sear the beef in the reserved bacon fat over medium-high heat until deeply browned on all sides. Lower the heat slightly if needed to prevent the fond (browned bits) from burning. Transfer seared beef to the stew pot as you go.
   </li>
<li>
    Sauté onions with ½ tsp salt until soft, 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute. Deglaze with stout; simmer 2–3 minutes.
   </li>
<li>
    Pour onion mixture into pot. Add tomato paste, thyme, carrots, celery, stock, sugar, and pepper.
   </li>
<li>
    Simmer covered for 2 hours. Uncover and cook 15–20 minutes more to thicken. Remove thyme stems.
   </li>
<li>
    Adjust seasoning. Serve over mashed potatoes.
   </li>
</ol>
<h3>
   Notes
  </h3>
<ul>
<li>
    For a thicker stew, whisk 1–2 tbsp (8–16 g) of flour into the sautéed onions before deglazing with stout. Cook for 1–2 minutes to eliminate raw flour taste.
   </li>
<li>
    Guinness is a classic choice for the stout.

<h3>
   Description
  </h3>
<p>
   This hearty, slow-cooked beef dish is inspired by the Italian classic *Brasato al Barolo*. While traditionally made with Barolo, any dry red wine you enjoy drinking—such as Pinot Noir—will work beautifully. The beef becomes meltingly tender, infused with the deep flavors of wine, aromatics, and warm spices.
  </p>
<h3>
   Ingredients
  </h3>
<ul>
<li>
    1 (3 lb / 1.4 kg) boneless beef chuck roast, patted dry
   </li>
<li>
    2 tsp kosher salt
   </li>
<li>
    1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
   </li>
<li>
    ¼ cup (60 ml) olive oil
   </li>
<li>
    ¼ cup (30 g) chopped pancetta or bacon
   </li>
<li>
    2 cups (300 g) chopped yellow onions
   </li>
<li>
    1 cup (130 g) chopped carrots
   </li>
<li>
    1 cup (100 g) chopped celery
   </li>
<li>
    1 tbsp (15 g) minced garlic
   </li>
<li>
    1½ bottles (about 1.1 liters) dry red wine (e.g., Pinot Noir, Dolcetto, Barbera)
   </li>
<li>
    2–4 cups (480–960 ml) beef stock
   </li>
<li>
    4 whole cloves
   </li>
<li>
    2 sprigs fresh rosemary
   </li>
<li>
    2 bay leaves
   </li>
<li>
    1 cinnamon stick
   </li>
<li>
    ¼ cup (15 g) chopped fresh parsley, for garnish
   </li>
</ul>
<h3>
   Instructions
  </h3>
<ol>
<li>
    **Sear the Beef:** In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Season beef with salt and pepper. Sear until browned on all sides. Remove and set aside.
   </li>
<li>
    **Sauté Aromatics:** Add pancetta and cook until crisp. Stir in onions, carrots, and celery; cook until caramelized, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook 30 seconds more.
   </li>
<li>
    **Deglaze and Braise:** Return beef to the pot. Add red wine and 2 cups of beef stock. Stir in cloves, rosemary, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 2½ to 3 hours, turning occasionally. Add stock as needed to keep beef mostly submerged.
   </li>
<li>
    **Reduce the Sauce:** Remove beef and tent with foil. Strain cooking liquid into a saucepan and discard solids. Simmer over high heat until reduced and glossy, about 10 minutes. Season to taste.
   </li>
<li>
    **Serve:** Slice beef against the grain and arrange on a platter. Spoon sauce over the top and garnish with chopped parsley.
   </li>
</ol>
<h3>
   Notes
  </h3>
<ul>
<li>
    **Wine Selection:** Barolo is traditional, but any dry red wine you enjoy—like Pinot Noir—works well.
   </li>
<li>
    **Make-Ahead Friendly:** This dish improves overnight. Reheat gently before serving.
   </li>
<li>
    **Serving Suggestions:** Pairs beautifully with creamy polenta, mashed potatoes, or crusty bread.

    ½ medium onion (75 g), diced

<h3>
   Instructions
  </h3>
<ol>
<li>
    In a medium skillet over medium heat, cook the chopped bacon until crisp.
   </li>
<li>
    Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside. Leave about 1 tablespoon of bacon fat in the pan.
   </li>
<li>
    Add the onion and bell pepper and sauté for 2–3 minutes, until beginning to soften.
   </li>
<li>
    Stir in the sliced hot dogs and cook for 3–4 minutes, until lightly browned.
   </li>
<li>
    Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.
   </li>
<li>
    Stir in the baked beans, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and reserved bacon.
   </li>
<li>
    Simmer uncovered for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened and heated through.

<li>
    Serve warm with toast, cornbread, or over rice.
   </li>
</ol>
<h3>
   Notes
  </h3>
<ul>
<li>
    Smoked sausage, kielbasa or cooked bratwurst can replace hot dogs for a richer variation. Go for about 8-10 oz.
   </li>
<li>
    Leftovers freeze well and reheat quickly.
