  <p>
   Fluffy, golden pancakes with crisp edges and tender insides. A well-balanced mix of tang, sweetness, and richness.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Ingredients
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    3 cups (375 g) all-purpose flour
   </li>
   <li>
    ¼ cup (50 g) sugar
   </li>
   <li>
    1½ tsp (9 g) salt
   </li>
   <li>
    1 tbsp (12 g) baking powder
   </li>
   <li>
    1½ tsp (6 g) baking soda
   </li>
   <li>
    2¼ cups (540 ml) milk
   </li>
   <li>
    ¼ cup (60 ml) neutral oil
   </li>
   <li>
    1 tbsp (15 ml) vanilla extract
   </li>
   <li>
    ¼ cup (60 ml) apple cider vinegar (or white vinegar)
   </li>
   <li>
    3 large eggs
   </li>
   <li>
    Butter and maple syrup, for serving
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Instructions
  </h3>
  <ol>
   <li>
    In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.
   </li>
   <li>
    In a separate bowl, mix milk, oil, vanilla, vinegar, and eggs. Let rest 5 minutes to allow the vinegar to react with the baking soda.
   </li>
   <li>
    Combine wet and dry ingredients just until mixed—stop when just combined, a few lumps are fine.
   </li>
   <li>
    Heat a skillet over medium. Grease lightly. Pour ¼ cup batter per pancake.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cook until bubbles start to pop on the surface and edges appear set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown, another 1-2 minutes.
   </li>
   <li>
    Serve while hot with butter and maple syrup.
   </li>

  <p>
   A savory sausage mix for patties or links.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Ingredients
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    5 lbs (2.25 kg) ground pork shoulder
   </li>
   <li>
    2 tbsp (40 g) plain salt
   </li>
   <li>
    ½ tbsp (3.5 g) white pepper
   </li>
   <li>
    ½ tbsp (2.5 g) ground sage
   </li>
   <li>
    ½ tsp (1 g) ginger powder
   </li>
   <li>
    ½ tbsp (1.5 g) nutmeg
   </li>
   <li>
    1 tsp (1.5 g) fresh thyme or rosemary, chopped
   </li>
   <li>
    ½ tbsp (3.5 g) cayenne pepper
   </li>
   <li>

  </ul>
  <h3>
   Instructions
  </h3>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Chill the mixing bowl and meat to below 40°F (4°C) before starting. Mix all ingredients by hand or using a stand mixer with paddle attachment until tacky. You will know that it is ready because a walnut sized chunk will stick to your palm while it is facing down and not fall off.
   </li>
   <li>
    Shape into patties or stuff into casings.
   </li>
   <li>
    Fry a small patty to taste for seasoning before shaping the rest.

    Store refrigerated for 3 days or freeze for 3 months.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
   Notes
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Brown sugar or maple syrup adds a subtle sweetness, but can be omitted for a savory profile.

   <li>1 box (10 oz / 284 g) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry</li>
      <li><em>or</em> 1 bunch fresh spinach (10 oz / 284 g), blanched and squeezed dry</li>
   <li>
    12 oz (340 g) extra-sharp cheddar, Monterey Jack (milder), or other cheese, shredded
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Instructions
  </h3>
  <ol>
   <li>
    If using fresh spinach: bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add spinach and cook for 30 seconds. Transfer to an ice water bath to stop the cooking. Drain and squeeze dry thoroughly.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cube bread into 1-inch pieces and place in a large bowl.
   </li>
   <li>
    Whisk eggs, cream, salt, pepper, cayenne, Dijon mustard, hot sauce (if using), and nutmeg. Pour over bread and let soak for 15–30 minutes.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cook sausage or bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Drain, reserving 1 tbsp fat.
   </li>
   <li>
    Grease a 9×13-inch baking dish with reserved sausage/bacon fat.
   </li>
   <li>
    Layer the strata as follows:
   </li>
   <li>
    Add half of the soaked bread cubes in an even layer.
   </li>
   <li>
    Sprinkle with 6 oz (170 g), or half, of the shredded cheese.
   </li>
   <li>
    Distribute the cooked sausage or bacon evenly over the cheese.

    Spread the spinach over the meat.
   </li>
   <li>
    Sprinkle with 3 oz (85 g), or one-quarter of the total cheese.
   </li>
   <li>
    Add the rest of the soaked bread, pressing down gently.
   </li>
   <li>
    Top with the final 3 oz (85 g), or one-quarter of the total cheese.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cover and rest for 1 hour at room temperature or refrigerate overnight. If chilled overnight, remove from fridge 30 minutes before baking to take the chill off.
   </li>
   <li>

   </li>
   <li>
    Optionally, broil for 1–2 minutes to crisp the top. Cool for 5–10 minutes before serving.
   </li>
  </ol>

  Description

 <p>
  A coastal twist on classic shakshuka: sardines and sweet peppers add richness and depth to this spiced tomato and egg dish. Excellent with crusty bread and easy to scale for brunch.
</p>
<h3>
  <h3>
   Ingredients
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    2 tbsp (30 ml) oil from sardine can
   </li>
   <li>
    ½ medium onion, diced (85 g)
   </li>
   <li>
    3 oz (85 g) diced sweet peppers
   </li>
   <li>
    1 clove garlic, minced (5 g)
   </li>
   <li>
    1 can (14 oz / 400 g) diced tomatoes
   </li>
   <li>
    1 tsp (5 g) seasoning blend of choice (e.g., Italian, za’atar, baharat, or berbere)
   </li>
   <li>
    1 can (3 oz / 85 g) sardines, drained
   </li>
   <li>
    4 large eggs
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Instructions
  </h3>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) if using the oven finish method.
   </li>
   <li>
    Heat sardine oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and peppers until soft, about 5 minutes.
   </li>
   <li>
    Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.
   </li>
   <li>
    Stir in diced tomatoes and seasoning. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
   </li>
   <li>
    Gently stir in sardines, breaking them slightly if desired.
   </li>
   <li>
    Crack the eggs into the skillet, spacing them evenly over the surface.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until egg whites are just set, about 4–5 minutes.
   </li>
   <li>
    *Alternatively*, transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 5–10 minutes until the whites are just set.
   </li>
   <li>
    Remove from heat and let rest for 1–2 minutes to allow carry-over heat to finish cooking.
   </li>
   <li>
    Serve hot, optionally garnished with fresh herbs or crusty bread.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
   Notes
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Finishing in the oven provides gentler, more even heat and helps avoid overcooking the bottoms of the eggs. It's especially useful if you're doubling the recipe or prefer a less runny texture. The stovetop method works well for everyday cooking and keeps cleanup minimal.
   </li>
   <li>
    You can experiment with different herbs, spices or seasoning mixes to suit your taste and available ingredients.

  Description
</h3>
<p>
  A warm, spiced Indian-style scrambled egg dish with tender cabbage, onions, green chilies, and curry leaves. Quick to prepare, deeply aromatic, and perfect with toast, paratha, or as a light lunch on its own.
</p>
<h3>
  Ingredients
</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
    2 tbsp (30 ml) avocado oil or ghee
   </li>
   <li>
    1 tsp cumin seeds
   </li>
   <li>
    8–10 fresh curry leaves
   </li>
   <li>
    1 small red onion (4 oz / 115 g), finely chopped
   </li>
   <li>
    2 green chilies, finely chopped <em>(use Indian green chilies, serrano, or jalapeño to taste)</em>
   </li>
   <li>
    1 tsp ground turmeric
   </li>
   <li>
    ½ tsp ground coriander (dhania)
   </li>
   <li>
    12–14 oz (340–400 g) green cabbage, finely shredded
   </li>
   <li>
    6 large eggs, beaten
   </li>
   <li>
    1 tsp garam masala
   </li>
   <li>
    Salt, to taste (start with 1 to 1½ tsp kosher salt)
   </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Instructions
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Heat oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add curry leaves and stir for 10–15 seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add chopped onion and green chilies. Sauté until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in turmeric and ground coriander. Cook for 30 seconds to bloom the spices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add shredded cabbage and salt. Cook 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is tender but not mushy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in the beaten eggs. Gently fold and stir until soft curds form and the eggs are just set.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sprinkle garam masala over the top and give a final stir. Serve hot.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>
  Notes
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Curry leaves are a cornerstone of South Indian cooking. Their unmistakable aroma and flavor can’t be faked — if you’ve never cooked with them, they’re worth seeking out at Indian grocers or specialty markets.
  </li>
  <li>
    For a softer texture, cover the cabbage for part of the cooking time to lightly steam it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Serve with toast, paratha, or even wrapped in a roti for a breakfast roll.
  </li>
