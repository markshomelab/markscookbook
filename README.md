# Mark's Homelab

This is a personal repository for projects, experiments, and documentation. It's a flexible space intended to grow over time without a strict roadmap. You may find anything from self-hosted utilities and static sites to notes and one-off tools.

## Cookbook

The cookbook is a collection of 76 (and growing) tested recipes, presented in a structured HTML format for easy browsing and offline access.
